1,"About as exciting as a trip to Hogwarts's most neglected lavatory."
2,"More workmanlike than magical, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' nevertheless feels like an upgrade from its predecessor, one that adds star power, introduces key characters and lays the foundation for a genuine 'Wizarding World' franchise."
3,"Despite being light in the story department, The Crimes of Grindelwald offers plenty of small pleasures and tightens up the linkage between this series and Harry Potter."
4,"With too much happening all at once and not enough focus on bulding characters we actually care about, the film fails to leave any sense of an impact, which makes me concerned that future installments will fall victim to the same trend."
5,"Part Two of J.K. Rowling's latest franchise is a bewildering bummer, a real misstep by this generally sure-footed storyteller."
6,"It's not only the film's boring lack of originality with respect to the previous one, it's also its similarity (like looking into a mirror) with the treatment of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
7,"It's always fun to decry a formulaic movie - except when the formula actually works."
8,"Although 'Creed 2' doesn't have the same rousing magic as the last chapter, it offers intriguing parallel plots of fathers and sons trying to find redemption after loss."
9,"Merely adopting a formula is easy - that happens all too often. Investing in a formula, making it breathe - that's the challenge, and 'Creed II' meets it."
10,"So, sure, Creed II has elements of boxing to it, but the heart of the story is with these men dealing with the emotions of fatherhood, opening up, and owning their past mistakes to move on with their futures."
11,"'Creed II' deftly pulls together threads from all of the 'Rocky' movies, underscoring that it's time to acknowledge that Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa is one of the greatest of all Hollywood characters."
12,"Perversely, a family film this is not: The Mouse King -- actually a writhing body of mice all working together as one moving mass -- is the stuff of children's nightmares."
13,"Maybe see it for the effects work and production design, both of which are nothing short of spectacular. "
14,"Considering the number of script doctors this must have had, it's a little amazing that not one of them noticed how deficient the bones of this thing are."
15,"Perhaps if you can disconnect your brain, there's something there, but it takes an awful amount of work to get there."
